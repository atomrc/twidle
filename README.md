The idea behind twidle is for you to generate an awesome twitter handle. But instead of a completly random string generated by a script, you have the **power over the pattern of your future twitter name**.

Yes, it's pattern based
=======

In fact, if your name is, let say, `Thomas`, you might want to have `tom` or `tomtom` or `thomas` in your twitter name.
For example, if you want to find a twitter name with tom at the begining, you can try :

    node twidle.js tom.

Twidle will automatically replace the `.` with all the letter of the alphabet and ask twitter if the name is available.

Follow the dots
----------

The `.` in the pattern represents the variables in the twitter name you want to generate.
For example :

    node twidle.js l.m.

will try the names:

- lama;
- lamb;
- lamc;
- [...]
- lzmz;

Well I think you get it.

Generate awesomness
=========

Now you just need nodejs and then you can start generating awesome twitter handles.

so you can:

    brew install node

or:

    apt-get install nodejs

or download it form here : http://nodejs.org/download/

And finally:

    node twidle.js <pattern>
